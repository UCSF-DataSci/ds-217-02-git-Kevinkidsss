	#- Use formatting to separate sections using `# Header`'s
	#- Add a link to the official Python website (https://www.python.org)
3. Python environments & packages
	- Create a virtual environment
	- Activate the virtual environment
	- Add the directory of the virtual environment to `.gitignore` (commit to repo)
	- Use `pip install` or `python -m pip install` to install a package (okay to use the example from lecture)
	- Take a screenshot of the installation
	- Add the screenshot to your assignment repository
4. Markdown
	- Add the screenshot image to your readme.md
	- Add a meme you like from the internet to readme.md
	- Commit and push changes back to GitHub
5. Check your work on GitHub, you should now have:
	- A single branch, `main`
	- Python file from assignment 1
	- `.gitignore` with at least one entry for the virtual environment folder
	- `readme.md` with assignment 1 content, plus images
